## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

This assignment helped me learn how to work with modules, lists, and dictionaries in Python. At first, I found it a bit tricky to parse the packaging data correctly, especially splitting the strings and handling the different parts of the input. However, by using the debugger and testing each step, I was able to figure it out. I also learned how to calculate the total units by multiplying the quantities from each level of packaging, which made sense once I saw how the numbers worked together. Writing the data to a JSON file was new to me, but it was straightforward after reading the documentation. The most challenging part was making sure the output matched exactly what was expected, but the tests helped me catch my mistakes. Overall, this assignment improved my understanding of parsing data and working with different data structures in Python. I feel more confident now in breaking down problems and using debugging tools to fix errors.
